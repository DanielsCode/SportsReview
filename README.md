Sport training video analysis tool for sports that require precise movements, swings, or timings.

Useful for:
* Baseball
* Cricket
* Cycling
* Golf
* Soccer
* etc.

A tool that allows you to:
* delay a live video stream by a number of seconds.  This allows you perform a training task such hitting a ball then immediately afterwards review what it looked like.
* pause the live stream and step through frame by frame
* record a small frames groups for later analysis

## Future work/ideas:
* Analysis Tool: allows user to process saved frame groups to produce:
 * Export as AVI/Mpeg
 * Generate graphs (from measurement capture devices)
 * Annotate video frames with: freehand lines (that can be adjusted frame by frame)
* Open source hardware (arduino):
 * USB handheld keyboard/joystick controller to quick access to features
 * USB/Wireless accelerometer device to fix to bat/club/person to analyise motion.  This would aid in improving timing of bat/ball sports and fixing swing/movement
