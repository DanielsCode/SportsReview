This allows you perform a training task such hitting a ball then immediately afterwards review what it looked like.\r\n* pause the live stream and step through frame by frame\r\n* record a small frames groups for later analysis\r\n\r\n## Future work/ideas:\r\n* Analysis Tool: allows user to process saved frame groups to produce:\r\n * Export as AVI/Mpeg\r\n * Generate graphs (from measurement capture devices)\r\n * Annotate video frames with: freehand lines (that can be adjusted frame by frame)\r\n* Open source hardware (arduino):\r\n * USB handheld keyboard/joystick controller to quick access to features\r\n * USB/Wireless accelerometer device to fix to bat/club/person to analyise motion.  This would aid in improving timing of bat/ball sports and fixing swing/movement\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
