<div class="title">Python install - Windows</div>

If you have already installed Python, proceed to [PySide](pyside-win.html) (or [PyQt4](pyqt4-win.html))

1. Download Python installed from: [https://www.python.org/download/](https://www.python.org/download/)
	* at this point we recommend using Python 2.7.6.
	* you will probably want the *Python 2.7.6 Windows X86-64 Installer*

2. Start the installer program (which is likely called *python-2.7.6.amd64.msi*)

3. Windows *may* decide this is a security risk.  Click **Run**

5. Choose which directory to install Python and click **Next >** (default is fine unless you don't have 
a C:)

8. Windows may ask you to confirm you want to install it.  Click **Yes** (Note: this may come up behind 
other windows so you may need to look for it)
